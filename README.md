# Isobel
### by [Andrew Barlow](https://github.com/dandrewbarlow)
This is a tarot reading program for folks who might not necessarily want to buy a tarot deck or techno-occultists
## Usage
Run `make` in command line to create executable.
`./isobel -n` will run it and draw n cards.
`./isobel` for CLI.

## Future Plans
A way to give descriptions of a card's meaning or to use a specific layout is a feature I want to add. A GUI is an option, but I'm a student and this is a personal project, so that is definitely further in the future.
