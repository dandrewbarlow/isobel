# Isobel
### by [Andrew Barlow](https://github.com/dandrewbarlow)
This is a tarot reading program for folks who might not necessarily want to buy a tarot deck or techno-occultists
## Usage
Currently works with a simple command line ui. Makefile should be set up so a simple `make` will create executable.

## Future Plans
I would like to set it up to be run using command line arguments if the user would prefer not to enter the ui. A way to give descriptions of a card's meaning or to use a specific layout is another feature I want to add. A GUI is an option, but I'm a student and this is a personal project, so that is definitely further in the future.
